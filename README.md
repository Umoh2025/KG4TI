Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, requiring advanced systems for real-time threat detection and mitigation. Traditional rule-based cybersecurity approaches are inadequate for modern, dynamic threats. This paper introduces a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based approach using Neo4j to enhance threat intelligence. It integrates multiple data sources, including threat reports, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and attack patterns, into a unified graph structure. This method enables scalable, adaptable, and insightful cyber defense strategies for global cybersecurity challenges.
